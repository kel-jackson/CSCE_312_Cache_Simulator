This program is a cache simulator written using Python3.

Before beginning this program, a file containing various hex values to be used for filling the RAM this simulator uses must be with the file for this simulator. Otherwise, the simulator will not work.

This cache simulator runs using the command line argument "python3 cachesimulator.py" followed by the file name for the content of the RAM. For example, if the file holding the content for the RAM is named input.txt, the command will be "python3 cachesimulator.py input.txt".
